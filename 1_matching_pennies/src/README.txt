# ACM Portfolio assignment 1 - Matching Pennies
by Study group 2,
Johanne, Ane, Ditlev & Elisius.

2 agents are constructed: A Reinforcement Learning and a Reiforcement Learning-Random ('bad loser').
We create two different scenarios where each play against a Win-Stay-Lose-Shift agent.
This results in two agent pairs:
- RL vs WSLS
- RL-R vs WSLS

## Run Script order

1. RL_vs_WSLS.R and RLR_vs_WSLS.r
2. analysis.r
